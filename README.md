# 343-LexingHW
This is the repository for my Lexing Homework for CIS-343

This repo includes a simple lexer that takes the input stream and divides it up into tokens, emitting these tokens. Also included is a bison file which dictates the sentences/syntax of the language. ZoomJoyStrong.c and ZoomJoyStrong.h have been added to give methods for the final intended purpose, which is to draw shapes, lines and dots like the popular "Paint" application. The sample.zjs file has been included to test drawing with this language.
